- **Insights**: APAC (~3.8M), EU (~3.2M), and US (~2.8M) lead markets; Phones (~1.8M), Copiers (~1.6M), and Chairs (~1.5M) top sub-categories. Canada (~0.2M) and Labels (~0.02M) lag.
- **Recommendations**: Focus marketing on APAC, EU, US, and top sub-categories. Reevaluate low performers like Canada and Labels for growth or discontinuation.

- **Description**: A table of monthly sales (2011-2014, total ~4.3M in 2014) and a bar chart of sales by return status (~10M non-returned, ~1M returned).
- **Insights**: Q4 (October-December) peaks (e.g., 4.3M in Dec 2014), Q1 dips (e.g., 241K in Jan 2014). Low returns suggest stable revenue.
